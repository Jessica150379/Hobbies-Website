                <p>My story begins growing up and attending school on the Cape Flats. I knew that I wanted to create a better life for myself.<br>
                    At the time, earning a living and financially contributing was more important than getting a decent education, so I got the minimum<br>
                    education and landed jobs in the financial/admin sector. I worked three jobs at the same time and discovered my first passion, which is my love<br> 
                    for dance. I worked as a dance instructor in the evening. I love being active and naturally gravitated towards gyms and there I discovered my passion for fitness.<br>
                    After some encouragement from the staff, I enrolled in numerous fitness based courses and walked into a Managerial position. I am qualified in Sports Massage, Exercise Specialist,<br>
                    Group training, and EMS (electro-muscular stimulation) training. I have worked on international Cruise liners and many Health Clubs in between until a very niche form of <br>
                    training became accessible in South Africa - EMS training. I started working as a Trainer for the first Bodytec EMS studio and quickly progressed to Studio Manager and within 2 years<br>
                    I was the owner of my first EMS studio. In the next 2 years I opened my second Studio. Throughout this whole process I always had a great passion and appreciation<br>
                    for technology and after 10 years in EMS field I finally took the plunge and enrolled in the Full Stack Web and Software Engineer course with Hyperion Dev.<br>
                <br>
                    I am excited to showcase all of my skills I have devoloped over the years coupled with the new skills I am currently learning, and roll them into one powerful punch.<br>
                    I am creative, analytical, logical, high attention to detail, high EQ and I am also great with people.<br>
                <br>
                    Who knows where this exciting, new venture takes me.<br>
                <br>
                       
                    The sky is the limit!
